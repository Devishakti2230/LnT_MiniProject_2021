<h1> Requirements </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

A complete calculator which involves functions like basic operations and some other operations like sqaure, square-root, cube, cube-root etc. Also the project includes logarithms, factorials, exponentials, power functions. The calculator program is written in C language with proper testing cases.

<h2> Research </h2>

Basically general calculator doesn't involve any log operations or factorial type of things or any operations related to finding complex calculations. It is easy to apply the values in the system to find the specific operations so that it can help many system. Thus by studying all these facts, the necessary steps is to take some actions to implement some operation to amke an application that required results in a better way.

<h2> Cost </h2>

Cost is very much concerned when we are going to make an project here the cost also plays an important role to build a project well behaved.But since it is a calculator it can vary according to the market and places by when and where it takes place.

<h2> Features </h2>

* Addition : The addition (sum function) is used by choosing the "+" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a+b.
* Subtraction : The subtraction (diff function) is used by choosing the "-" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a-b.
* Multiplication : The multiplication (mul function) is used by choosing the "*" operand using the keyboard. The function results in ab.
* Division : The division (div function) is used by choosing the "/" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a/b.
* Modulous: The modulous gives the remainder of the division functions.(%)
* Square: This can be done by choosing "sq" symbol.
* Cube: This can be done by choosing "cb" symbol.
* Square_root: This can be done by choosing "sqr" symbol.
* Cube_root: This can be done by choosing "cbr" symbol.
* Logarithm : The logarithm (LOG) is resulted LOG() where base is 10.
* Factorial : The Factorial function is resulted x!=x*(x-1)...2*1.
* Power function : The raise to the power (y_raised_to_x function) is resulted y^x.

<h2> Defining System </h2>

This system includes the basic operations along with health, and advanced mathematical application which works in one way.

<h2> 4 W's and 1 H </h2>

<h3> WHO </h3>
The project can be used almost by all. All the scintific related problem will goin to help students who can use the program to find out the answer they need. At the end, user satisfaction is the goal of the project.

<h3> WHAT </h3>
Calculations related to basic math and scinece and complex calculation can be calculated quickly. All the basics functionalities are included in the project. User can use the program efficiently and get the required results.

<h3> WHEN </h3>
The project can be used at the time of solving the calculations and get the results for basic and scintific related problems. The result will be obtained quickly.

<h3> WHERE </h3>
In all the domains it can be used. As the project is portable and user-friendly, it can be easily implemented on the mobile systems and scinece problems. It should overcome all the drawbacks of the Old existing system and most important of all meet the user requirements.

<h3> HOW </h3>
System design is a solution for “HOW TO” approach to the creation of a new system. It translates system requirements into ways by which they can be made operational. It is a translational from a user oriented document to a document oriented programmers. For that, it provides the understanding and procedural details necessary for the implementation. Here UML diagrams are used to supplement the working of the new system. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs.
